Flexible-face signage is a much safer alternative to rigid faces, especially in regions 
with high winds and storms. If there’s a sign blow out, rigid materials can 
shatter and become flying projectiles. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="Arial" size="2">
Flex is also appropriate for signs with 
faces larger than 10 feet by 10 feet because making these signs with rigid faces 
would require a seam in the polycarbonate that many 
customers find unattractive. Flexible-faces should not be used for signs that are 
low to the ground, like monument signs as the flex face material is susceptible to vandalism. </FONT></P>

<P><font face="Arial" size="2">Flex face can be decorated with digital printing 
or applied vinyl. When ordering be sure to the specify copy area and trim size 
that you require.</font></P>
